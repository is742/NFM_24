# NFM 2024 Case Study

Model and properties for the submitted NFM 2024 paper

File [UAV_model.prism](https://github.com/is742/NFM_24/blob/main/UAV_model.prism) contains the sythnesised Markov Decision Process (MDP) model used for the verification and selection of appropriate reconfiguration options with the aim of satisfying the mission requirements.

File [properties.pctl](https://github.com/is742/NFM_24/blob/main/properties.pctl) contains the multi-objective properties used for policy synthesis. 

Folder [MDP model generation](https://github.com/is742/NFM_24/tree/main/MDP%20model%20generation) contains the [modelGen.py](https://github.com/is742/NFM_24/blob/main/MDP%20model%20generation/modelGen.py) script that receives input from the [config.json](https://github.com/is742/NFM_24/blob/main/MDP%20model%20generation/config.json) file, and generates the MDP model according to the defined parameters.
